# Learning and forecasting Satellite orbit from data
Data and helper script for the mini Hackathon to learn symbolic models from satellite orbits.

## Prerequiste
Make sure you have SciPy and NumPy and Matplotlib installed.
```
!pip install scipy numpy matplotlib pandas
```

## Getting Started
Go to `GettingStarted.ipynb` and follow through the file!

The slides `OrbitIntro.pptx` contain a lot of domain knowledge / prior knowledge of the problem that will really help you tackle the problem. Incorporating prior knowledge is a crucial step towards success!

## When you have a model for the perturbation forces $F_R$ $F_S$ $F_W$ (as functions of the elements)
Go to `EquinoctialPropagation.ipynb` / `KeplerianPropagation.ipynb` to see how to use the utility functions to propagate the orbit.

## Solution

The answer to this learning problem can be found in the `solution` branch of this repo. Try not to look at the answer and have a go yourself first!
