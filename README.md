# SymbolicOrbit
Data and helper script for the mini Hackathon to learn symbolic models from satellite orbits.

## Prerequiste
Make sure you have SciPy and NumPy and Matplotlib installed.
```
!pip install scipy numpy matplotlib pandas
```

## Getting Started
Go to `GettingStarted.ipynb` and follow through the file!

## When you have a model for the perturbation forces $F_R$ $F_S$ $F_W$ (as functions of the elements)
Go to `EquinoctialPropagation.ipynb` / `KeplerianPropagation.ipynb` to see how to use the utility functions to propagate the orbit.
